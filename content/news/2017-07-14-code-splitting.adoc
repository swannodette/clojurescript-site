As client applications increase in size it becomes desirable to optimize the
time to load a logical screen. Network requests should be minimized while at the
same the loaded code should be restricted to that which is absolutely necessary
to produce a functioning screen. While tools like
https://webpack.github.io[Webpack] have popularized this optimization technique
in the JavaScript mainstream, Google Closure Compiler and Library have supported
this same optimization strategy in the form of Google Closure Modules for many
years now.

Google Closure Modules also provide some unique advantages over tools
like Webpack or http://rollupjs.org[Rollup] which we will cover in the technical
section of this post. In short, we optimally assign all sources to modules
after which Google Closure Compiler employs dead code elimination (tree shaking)
and cross module code motion to produce truly optimal splits.

While ClojureScript has provided basic integration with this facility for some
time, the next release will feature greatly enhanced and comprehensive support
for code splitting and asynchronous loading of these splits.

=== Terminology

If you are familiar with Webpack terminology, in the following description
please take note that **module** in this context refers to a **code split** or
**chunk**.

By *entry point* we mean a source file which represents a logical entry point
into your application (login, users, admin, etc.).

== Enhanced Code Splitting

It is no longer necessary to hand-optimize module assignment of your sources.
All sources will be optimally assigned to a module based upon the dependency
graph of your application. If you have a module with many manual assignments you
should now remove these. If you were using namespace wildcard matching, this is
also no longer necessary. For details about how we assign an input to a
particular module see the technical description below.

Concretely, the following is now an anti-pattern:

[code,clojure]
```
{:modules
  {:vendor {:output-to "..."
            :entries '#{cljsjs.react reagent.* re-frame.*}}
   :main   {:output-to "..."
            :entries '#{myapp.core}
            :depends-on [:vendor]}}
```

Previously you would have to manually pin a source (`re-frame` in this case) and
its dependencies to a module. Now all that is required is:

[code,clojure]
```
{:modules
  {:vendor {:output-to "..."
            :entries '#{re-frame.core}
   :main   {:output-to "..."
            :entries '#{myapp.core}
            :depends-on [:vendor]}}
```

Another significant enhancement is that `:modules` now works under all
optimization settings. By unifying `:modules` behavior under all compilation
modes we eliminate a bit of incidental complexity around build configuration
between development and production.

== cljs.loader

Asynchronous loading of module splits is now standardized with the introduction
of the `cljs.loader` namespace. If any entry point in your application needs
to invoke the load of another module due to some user action, you can now do so
with `cljs.loader`.

`cljs.loader` provides a shared Google Closure
https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.module.ModuleManager.html[ModuleManager]
singleton automatically initialized to your `:modules` graph
regardless of the optimization level.

The following is a simple short example of `cljs.loader` functionality:

[code,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
 (:require [cljs.loader :as loader]
           [goog.dom :as gdom]
           [goog.events :as events])
 (:import [goog.events EventType]))

(events/listen (gdom/getElement "button") EventType.CLICK
  (fn [e]
    (loader/load :bar
      (fn [e]
        ((resolve 'bar.core/woz))))))
```

Note that this example shows how to call across module boundaries without
having the compiler complain about functionality not present in this code split.
This is possible thanks to the recent inclusion of static `resolve` to the
standard library.

For a complete walk through of the enhanced `:modules` functionality please
refer the new guide.

== Technical Description

The following highlights some interesting technical details of the enhanced
modules functionality.

=== Module Assignment

This section briefly describes the algorithm employed to automatically assign
every source file to a module.

Assume a simplified module description like:

[code,clojure]
```
{:modules {:module-a {:entries #'{foo.core}}
           :module-b {:entries #'{bar.core}}}
```

This will be transformed into a module description that includes the implicit
base module `:cljs-base`.

[code,clojure]
```
{:modules {:cljs-base {:entries []}
           :module-a  {:entries #'{foo.core}
                       :depends-on [:cljs-base]}
           :module-b  {:entries #'{bar.core}
                       :gdepends-on [:cljs-base]}}
```

We will then compute the depth of every module in the graph:

[code,clojure]
```
{:modules {:cljs-base {:entries [] :depth 0}
           :module-a  {:entries #'{foo.core} :depth 1
                       :depends-on [:cljs-base]}
           :module-b  {:entries #'{bar.core} :depth 1
                       :depends-on [:cljs-base]}}
```

We then use this to compute a mapping from all depended upon inputs to
a set of possible module assignments. For example we find all dependencies of
`foo.core` and we assume they will go into `:module-a` - even `cljs.core` the
standard library.

But of course `:module-b` will also assign `cljs.core` to itself. So
`cljs.core` module assignment is `#{:module-a :module-b}`. However we can
only choose one. To choose we first find all the common parent modules. Once
found, we pick the module with the greatest `:depth` value.

Finally, any orphans will be assigned to `:cljs-base`.

Readers familiar with Webpack will note that this is a simplification which
doesn't require managing splits via source code or any additional plugins.

=== Cross Module Code Motion

Automatic module assignment pushes code upwards to produce code splits that
match user expectations. However if we left it at that we would be missing a
huge opportunity. Along with dead code elimination Google Closure Complier
employs another useful optimization - *cross module code motion*. Individual
program values (including functions and methods) which are free of side effects
can be moved back down* the module graph.

A functional programming language like Clojure is well suited for this kind
of optimization and the ClojureScript compiler carefully generates code in
many cases to take advantage of this capability.

In practice this means that if some single function present in `:cljs-base` is
only ever used in `:module-a` will be moved back to `:module-a`.

== Conclusion

While Google documented these capabilities in Closure: The Definitive Guide
published in 2010, we believe they still represent the state of the art with
respect to optimal client production builds.
